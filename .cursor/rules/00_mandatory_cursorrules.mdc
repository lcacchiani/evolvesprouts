description: Always load and apply repository cursorrules
alwaysApply: true
---

Before doing any work in this repository, read `@.cursorrules` and execute its
requirements.

Minimum behavior for every task:

1. Load `@.cursorrules` before analysis, planning, commands, or edits.
2. Follow all mandatory and path-specific sections in that file.
3. Re-load `@.cursorrules` if it is modified during the session.
4. Do not perform implementation actions until explicit user approval is
   provided for the current task.
5. Treat all write operations as implementation actions (file edits, dependency
   changes, migrations, generated artifacts, and `git add`/`git commit`/`git
   push`).

Do not continue with implementation if `@.cursorrules` has not been applied.
