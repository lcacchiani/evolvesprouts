alwaysApply: true
---

Before doing any work in this repository, read `@.cursorrules` and execute its
requirements.

Minimum behavior for every task:

1. Load `@.cursorrules` before analysis, planning, commands, or edits.
2. Follow all mandatory and path-specific sections in that file.
3. Re-load `@.cursorrules` if it is modified during the session.

Do not continue with implementation if `@.cursorrules` has not been applied.
